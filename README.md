# Auto downloader script for use in conjunction with yt-dlp.

I am uploading this for my own benefit, you are free to use and modify it as you see fit.
I may eventually make this more user friendly.
If you look at the script, it is not hard to figure out where to place the URLs of the content creators you like, their channel names, and where you want the videos to be saved.
As this script works with arrays, it is important to keep everything in the same sequential order.

## Directions

This script requires yt-dlp you can install for your distro or get it here: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp

Download my script.

Place somewhere within your path.

As of right now, edit the script manually.

Add the channel or playlist URL, surrounded by quotes, in the channels array.

Add what you want the channel names to be, surrounded by quotes, in the channel_names array.

Add the directories you want the channels to be saved in, surrounded by quotes, in the channel_dirs array.

It is very important that the channel URL, channel name and download directories remain in the same order or the script will not function as intended.
