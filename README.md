This is an auto downloader script for use in conjunction with yt-dlp.
I am uploading this for my own benefit, you are free to use and modify it as you see fit.
I may eventually make this more user friendly.
If you look at the script, it is not hard to figure out where to place the URLs of the content creators you like, their channel names, and where you want the videos to be saved.
As this script works with arrays, it is important to keep everything in the same sequential order.
